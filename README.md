# flask_5_tailwind

## Design Process
Just wanted to showcase my aquarium so I don't think anything special was needed.

## CDN Process
Azure didn't work (see screenshot) so I moved to GCP. Ran into an issue where I accidentally pasted the HTML code into the terminal and it broke for a day. Came back the next day and it fixed. Weird.
Utilized the provided CDN tutorial on GCP. Straightforward.

## Observations
Would be useful in the creation of your own website. Can put your own designs or videos in there. Pretty cool if you're a web designer.

## Challenges
Just having to move to GCP.
